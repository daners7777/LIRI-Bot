LIRI Bot<br>
Overview<br>
Included are the files that will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and<br> Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app<br>
that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
